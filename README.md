# Minesweeper
This is a fun little side project that I have been working on in Java to practice my coding after a long break of not really coding. The name is self-explanatory.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT. 
BE AWARE THERE MIGHT BE MANY BUGS AS WELL AS ORGANIZATION, OPTIMIZATION, AND/OR CODE DOCUMENTATION CHANGES THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE MADE.

THIS CODE IS KINDA A MESS ILL BE HONEST.

Currently supports a default game mode of low difficulty (10% of the board are mines) and a custom game mode in which the user can specify the length, width, and difficulty of the game.
These variables have not had proper constraints put in place, so if you feel like it breaks the whole program by putting in negative numbers or numbers >=100 for the length/width and
numbers > 10 for the difficulty to break the code. 

Feel free to fork the code and make any changes that you think would make the program better. Pull requests will also be considered.

Thanks for playing!
